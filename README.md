# Hand-Gesture-controlled-Bot-
Hand Gesture controlled Bot on ARM LPC2378 microcontroller

This project has been done as an evaluatory component of Higher Degree course EEE G512 Embedded Systems Design under the supervision of 
Ms. Meetha V. Shennoy.

This project involves contructing of a Bot which could be controlled by the user wirelessly using the commands interpreted from the 
hand gestures. It consist of the following components-
1. Accelerometer
2. 4 Wheel Bot (Rover 5)
3. 2 NXP LPC2378 Microcontrollers
4. 2 RS 232 Uart module
5. 1 ZigBee Module
6. 1 Flex Sensor
7. 1 IR Sensor
8. Motor Driver L293D IC
9. 1300 mAh LiPo Battery

As of now, the programe uploaded dosen't have the I2C code portion which i used to interface MPU 9250/ ADXL 435 accelerometer. I was facing 
some problems with it. I also tried SPI protocol for interfacing ADXL 435 but it didn't work. 
Will upload the final code as soon as it start working ( After Dec :( )
